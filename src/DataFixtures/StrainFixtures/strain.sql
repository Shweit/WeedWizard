Dawggone Skunk is all about bringing the old school to the new school. This Plant grows really well indoor and outdoor showing great strength, vigor, and resistance to the elements. She performs at a well balanced pace throughout all cycles of growth. Upon flower we experienced minimal amounts of stretching which is a plus indoor. We did required supports for the heavy flowers that the Dawggone Skunk develops. Flower time was 9 weeks and yields were very good indoor and out. This cultivar is very strong and produces large amounts of trichcombes and wide range of colors on her flowers. Huge colas prodced so be prepared. Dawggone Skunk builds upon SubCools the dank flavor profile on the Dawggone Sour which is a wonderful blend of Chem citrus aromas. Its aroma are complex, mixing sour, acidic notes with guava, citrus and Chem nuances of pine and gasoline in an intense and well balanced combination, which is greatly enhanced if we consume it in a cannabis vaporiser.

Tropicana Cherry owes its distinct flavor and euphoric high to Relentless Genetics\' own Cherry Cookies F3 male and Bloom Seed Co&rsquo;s Tropicana Cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tropicana Cherry has a distinct appearance thanks to its maroon-coloured buds and purple-tinted leaves. Trop Cherry acts as you would expect from a slightly sativa-dominant hybrid. She grows tall, with a mild stretch at the end of the vegetative phase. She produces ample lateral growth, making Screen of Green （ScrOG） an ideal training strategy. Speaking of flavors and aromas, expect your grow room to be filled with heavy sour notes and undertones of sharp citrus. The ensemble of fruity flavors is complemented by hints of tart cherry and earthy nuttiness, the perfect homage to its GSC-derived genetics. Tropicana&rsquo;s influence focuses firmly on the mind, uplifting and energizing even the most hardened cannabis lover. You can expect a subtle sensation to start before slowly building towards wave after wave of euphoria. Tropicana Cherry is teeming with several potentially beneficial terpenes, including caryophyllene, limonene and pinene. The former, caryophyllene, is one of the most abundant and may help activate receptors in the immune system. Limonene, on the other hand, not only contributes to the strain&rsquo;s intense tangerine-like aroma, but may play a positive role in mood-related disorders. Whether you prefer cultivating indoors or letting plants flourish outdoors, Trop Cherry is well-suited to both. Indoor growers will find that plants mature after roughly sixty five days of flowering, which is fast for a sativa-dominant hybrid. She also responds positively to both high and low-stress training. Tropicana Cherry is a standout hybrid with impressive flavors, potency, and decent results in the grow room. Her distinct sweet and sour citrus taste is evident from the first hit to the last, and alongside the euphoric and uplifting high, makes for an invigorating experience you can enjoy both with friends and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grower level:&nbsp;Easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps: energy, focus, creativity ,pain relief&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell/Taste:&nbsp; tangerine-like sweet and sour tart cherry and earthy nuttiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family:&nbsp;Sativa Dominant Hybrid （60/40）&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indoor/Outdoor:&nbsp;Both&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:&nbsp;Medium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flower Time:&nbsp;Flowers 9 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lineage:&nbsp;Mother- Tropicana Cherry x Father- Tropicana Cherry （reversal）&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex:&nbsp;Feminized&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo: 12/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yield:&nbsp;Medium flowers: 9 weeks", "flowering": {"auto": false, "days": 63, "info": "Blütezeit ~63 Tage"}, "description": "Specialty seed company in USA.

We have many fond memories of mornings riding into the snow coated purple mountains to enjoy our favorite winter pastimes. Anticipation building while you relaxed and enjoyed the scenery as you missed all of the automobile traffic to the mountains. While the actual train has been sold, and the line shut down the 303 Seeds Ski Train is bound to bring happy memories to any and all that take a ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A superb lemon citrus taste dominates the palate, with subtle sour berry hints and the explosion of creamy hash tones. The resin coverage is impressive, and coats the buds like the peaks of the Rockies on a crisp winter morning. Vigorous growth, and a dense supportive branching structure make for the perfect Trainwreck experience. Excellent sativa heavy head, with a perfect combo of relaxed but active body make this an all day medication. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 303 Seeds Limited Edition Release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genetics: Selected [(Arcata Trainwreck x Super Silver Haze) x Pakistan Chitral Kush] F2&lt;br /&gt;Phenotype: Sativa/Indica mix&lt;br /&gt;Indoor Flowering Time: 55-65 days", "flowering": {"auto": false, "days": 60, "info": "Blütezeit ~60 Tage"}, "description": "303 (three-oh-three) was the original telephone area code for Denver, Colorado.

Many thanks to our friend BudPatch who came across the seeds directly from the breeder at Cabin Fever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goddess Kush has the most amazing strawberry watermelon bubble gum flavor that you could possibly imagine. Loompa\'s Headband and Chem D completely change the terpene profile of this kush, and we think it is the best tasting and smelling plant we\'ve come across in some time. In addition, the THC and CBD profiles are very strong, allowing for maximum pain relief and analgesic benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ski Train male leads this beauty into a complex citrus snowstorm.
